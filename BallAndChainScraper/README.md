Scrapes beverage data from http://www.ball-and-chain-restaurant.com/ and converts to JSON.

Ideas
=====

- Combine into bigger Drink Different project. Multiple scrapers, find new beers in lots of locations.
 - Define an interface for the scrapers
- Link beverages with untappd records.
 - For now manually search and provide IDs
 - Cache name -> ID for future lookup
